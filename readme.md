# Quest - Exploring Languages

Welcome to **Quest**â€”a repository dedicated to exploring programming languages purely out of curiosity and interest. These languages may not be used in my main projects, but they provide an excellent opportunity for learning and experimentation. Whether you're here to observe, learn, or contribute, you're welcome to join this journey.

## Contributions Welcome
Contributions are highly encouraged and simple to make:

1. Create a folder named `Quest for [Language Name]`.
2. Add example code, tutorials, or small projects related to that language.

For larger contributions or structural changes, we recommend opening an issue to discuss your ideas before making any changes.
